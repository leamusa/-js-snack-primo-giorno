////// Exercise 1: Declare a variable and print its value in the console \\\\\
let number = 100; // number
console.log(number); // Print the value //

////// Exercise 2: Declare a constant and print its value in the console \\\\\
const PI = 3.14; // number (constant)
console.log(PI); // Print the value of the constant

////// Exercise 2/B: Attempt to reassign a value to a constant\\\\\
// const PI  = 3.1416;
// console.log(PI);
// error because constants cannot be reassigned.

////// Exercise 2/C: Operations with variables and constants \\\\\
let radius = 8; //variable called radius and value 8
let circle = radius * 2 * PI; // Multiply radius by 2 and PI
console.log(circle); // Print the value 'circle' variable in the console.

////// Exercise 3: Modify the value of a variable and print it in the console \\\\\
let name = "Emma"; // string   variable called name and assign it the value  "Emma".
console.log(name); // Print the value of the 'name' variable in the console.
name = "Giorgia";
console.log(name); // Print the new value of the ' Giorgia' variable in the console.

////// Exercise 4: Increase the temperature and print the new value in the console \\\\\
let temperature = 22.5; // number
temperature += 5; // Increase the value of 'temperature' by 5.
console.log(temperature); // Print the new value of the 'temperature' variable in the console.

////// Exercise 5: Numbers \\\\\

/*
The difference between the number 3.14 and 100 is their numerical value. 
3.14 is a decimal number representing a fraction, while 100 is a whole number.
3.14 is of type 'number' and represents a floating-point number (decimal),
while 100 is also of type 'number' and represents an integer.
*/
////// Exercise 6: Console \\\\\
/*
The main difference between console.info('My message') and console.log() is in the styling and presentation of the output.
console.info() is often used for informational messages and might be styled differently in some browser consoles, making it stand out.

Other console methods include:
- console.warn('Warning message') for displaying warning messages.
- console.error('Error message') for displaying error messages.
- console.table(data) for displaying data in tabular form.

These methods provide different ways to format and display information in the console.
